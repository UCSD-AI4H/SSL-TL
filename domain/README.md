# Domain Distance
This repository offers the code to calculate domain distance between source and target dataset with
1. Visual distance:
    - This is an implementation of an algorithm discussed in [Domain-Adversarial Training of Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.07818).
    - It computes the Proxy A-Distance (PAD) between two domain distributions. PAD is a measure of similarity between datasets from different domains.
2. Class similarity
    - It offers the code to calculate similarity of different dataset based on dataset labels using cosine similarity and GloVe embedding.
